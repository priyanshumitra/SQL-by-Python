# SQL-by-Python

Hello Everyone, This is my first ever repository in github to start my journey with @github. So, my repository is related to SQL by python and yeah just like as their work also as their repository name. This is about the basic fundamentals and operations of SQL which is performed by Python.

There are Total 10 Program files which are related to basic operations with SQL and 1 another file which is related to the Small SQL project like that.

Firstly If you want to run SQL by python then you have to install any SQL application like mysql, oracle, microsoft sql etc. But I would prefer you that you should install mysql for easy to understand about SQL. So, install SQL application firstly then connect to the VScode(I prefer you to run VScode editor for better performance and easy to understand their functionality).

For connect mysql to VScode,
1.Goto cmd
2. type "pip install mysql-connector-python"(Your VScode has python extension so)
3.After that, your mysql will successfully connect with your VScode.

Let's Start to learn basic SQL operations by Python as python files,
prog1.py :- Program to connect the Python to MySQL database 
prog2.py :- Program to create Database
prog3.py :- Program to create the Table in Database
prog4.py :- Program to print all databases in MySQL and Tables in their databases
prog5.py :- Program to insert the data in table of database
prog6.py :- Program to insert multiple data in table of database at a time 
prog7.py :- Program to print all the data from table of database
prog8.py :- Program to update the data of table of database and print it also
prog9.py :- Program to delete the data from table of database
prog10.py :- Program to delete all data from table of database
prog11.py :- Program to fetch the data related to company(DB) and do other operations with their database(company)

Hope, It'll help to all of you to easily understanding about "SQL by Python".
If you have any questions please let me know.

Thank You.......
